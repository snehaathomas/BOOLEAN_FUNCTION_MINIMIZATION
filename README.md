# BOOLEAN_FUNCTION_MINIMIZATION

**AIM:**

To implement the given logic function verify its operation in Quartus using Verilog programming.

F1= A’B’C’D’+AC’D’+B’CD’+A’BCD+BC’D 

F2=xy’z+x’y’z+w’xy+wx’y+wxy

**Equipment Required:**

Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher

**Software – Quartus prime**

**Theory**
Boolean Algebra was given by George Boole. It is a set of rules used to simplify a given logical expression without changing its functionality. It is mainly used when several variables present are less. The algebraic expression used in Boolean Algebra is known as Boolean Expression and it is used to describe Boolean Function. The Boolean expression generally consists of value 0 or 1, binary variables, and logical operation.

Truth Table Formation
The truth table is a table that comprises all the possible outcomes of a Boolean function used in Boolean algebra. It is used to establish a relation between various variable that contributes to the Boolean function. 1 in the Truth table represents true value and 0 represents false value. Truth Table provides us with an easy method to test whether a given argument is valid or not for legitimate input.

**Logic Diagram**

**Procedure**

1.	Type the program in Quartus software.

2.	Compile and run the program.

3.	Generate the RTL schematic and save the logic diagram.

4.	Create nodes for inputs and outputs to generate the timing diagram.

5.	For different input combinations generate the timing diagram.
